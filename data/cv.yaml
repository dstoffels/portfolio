about: |+
  Back in 2011, I began developing Wordpress sites for local artists as a hobby and found I was well suited for dev life. After several years of web development, I tried my hand in the gaming world with C# and Unity. Now I have two years of tenure teaching full-stack engineering at a bootcamp and several deployed projects under my belt.

  I enjoy working with raw data and building systems that automate or manipulate it. I love developing with Django and React, taking great care to write clean, efficient and extendable code. I've also produced a complete React course that includes a video tutorial series along with lectures and projects.

  When I'm not putting miles on the keyboard, I'm putting miles on my camper van, hiking, cycling or playing drums with my bands.

summary: |+ 
  With over 12 years of experience ranging from web development to full stack engineering, I specialize in React and Django. I have instructed over 1000 students in the fields of audio and software engineering during my 8 years in higher education. My passion for music, technology and teaching brings a structured and creative approach that results in innovative solutions.
